# Uncreative Items
---
A [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org) plugin by [heisluft](https://github.com/heisluft), which gives you the ability 
to give yourself Items not shown in creative inventory without having to know the /give or the /replaceitem command.

### Farewell my old project.
Its functional and has nice general-use methods. I will continue to use this as a function library and as a reference for other plugins, but development is dormant
