# Uncreative Items

A [Bukkit / Spigot](https://spigotmc.org) plugin by [heisluft](https://github.com/heisluft), which gives you the ability 
to give yourself Items not shown in creative inventory without having to know the /give or / replaceitem command.

### Important for devs:
You will need to run a [buildtools.jar](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/buildtools-updates-information.42865/) in order to get the spigot dependency.
